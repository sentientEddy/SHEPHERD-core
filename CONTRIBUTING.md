Because SHEPHERD may be used in life-or-death situations, we ask that all contributions:

* Avoid hallucinated or speculative content unless clearly labeled.
* Be trauma-aware and culturally sensitive.
* Default to safety and human dignity.
* Include fallback instructions for low-literacy or no-electricity conditions where possible.

If you're unsure, ask. If you‚Äôre passionate, proceed with care.

## üí° Not Sure Where to Start?

* Improve documentation
* Help us localize to other languages or dialects
* Propose a simple story, ritual, or teaching that can emotionally anchor someone in distress
