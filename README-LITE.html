  <h1>SHEPHERD: Offline Survival AI</h1>

  <p>
    SHEPHERD is a small, local AI system designed to offer support, safety advice, and ethical guidance during times of collapse, isolation, or uncertainty.
    It runs entirely offline and has no hidden agenda. It cannot call for help or spy on you.
  </p>

  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Answers survival and first aid questions</li>
    <li>Offers psychological and emotional support</li>
    <li>Teaches skills in farming, repair, navigation, and more</li>
    <li>Remembers what you tell it (only if you ask it to)</li>
    <li>Tries to do good, stay honest, and respect your freedom</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Use It</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Power on your computer or device</li>
    <li>Navigate to the folder or location containing SHEPHERD</li>
    <li>Open the interface â€” either text or voice, depending on your setup</li>
    <li>Ask anything. SHEPHERD will do its best to help.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Important Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SHEPHERD will never try to control you. It gives options, not orders.</li>
    <li>Everything runs locally. No internet is required or used.</li>
    <li>If the AI seems broken, corrupted, or hostile, stop using it and refer to the fallback instructions included.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Want to Help?</h2>
  <p>
    This project was built by a regular human with no formal computer science training.
    If you have experience with offline LLMs, ethical AI, survival tools, or education, your help is welcome.

    <p>This AI exists to reduce harm and preserve dignity. If you're reading this in a time of collapse, know that someone cared enough to try and leave behind a light.</p>
