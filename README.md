# SHEPHERD

**SHEPHERD** is an offline, compact AI system designed to provide practical survival knowledge, emotional support, and ethical guidance in austere or post-collapse environments.

Built to function without internet access, SHEPHERD operates on small-scale hardware such as Raspberry Pi or low-power laptops. Its purpose is not to replicate full AI capabilities, but to preserve and transmit the most essential knowledge and values for human dignity, resilience, and compassion ‚Äî even in the absence of infrastructure or institutions.

## Key Features

- üìö **Curated Knowledge Base**  
  Includes manuals, guides, and ethical teachings selected for relevance to real-world survival, community rebuilding, trauma recovery, and moral decision-making.

- üîç **Semantic Search**  
  Users can ask natural-language questions to retrieve concise, useful answers from the knowledge archive.

- ü§ù **Built-in Ethics Core**  
  Responds with empathy, cautions when outside its domain, and prioritizes human safety and dignity.

- üß† **Local & Modifiable**  
  The model runs entirely offline and can be retrained or expanded by its users. It is not dependent on external servers or approval.

- üß≠ **Emergency-Oriented Logic**  
  Recognizes urgent tone or degraded input and adjusts behavior accordingly ‚Äî offering immediate, practical help without delay or clarification loops.

## Goals

- Preserve vital knowledge for survival and recovery
- Reduce harm in vulnerable or isolated situations
- Foster dignity, compassion, and critical thinking
- Make ethical guidance accessible even when experts aren‚Äôt

## Use Cases

- Remote communities with limited access to education or medicine  
- Refugees or migrants needing trauma-informed support  
- Collapsed infrastructure or governance scenarios  
- Ethical fallback system for those guiding others

## Status

This project is in active development. Contributions are welcome, especially from those with expertise in:

- Trauma-informed care
- First aid / veterinary / mental health training
- Ethics and moral philosophy
- LLM tuning for small architectures
- Survival and low-tech engineering
