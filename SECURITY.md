# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability, ethical concern, or misuse risk related to this project, please report it responsibly.

Email reports to:  
**eddy.projectvirgil@proton.me**

We aim to respond to all security-related messages within **5 business days**.

Please include as much relevant information as possible, including:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations

## Scope

This project includes experimental tools designed to function in degraded, post-collapse environments. While we prioritize safety and ethical operation, SHEPHERD is provided **as-is**, without warranties or guarantees.

Known scope areas include:

- Offline use of local AI models
- Interaction with survival and ethical training datasets
- Limited execution environments (Raspberry Pi, air-gapped systems, etc.)

## Out of Scope

This project does **not** include:

- Online data fetching
- Remote telemetry
- Centralized model governance

SHEPHERD is designed to be independently auditable and self-contained.

## Responsible Use

Contributors and users are expected to uphold the core principles of the SHEPHERD system:

- Do no harm
- Preserve human dignity
- Encourage ethical survival
- Remain transparent and teachable

If any use of this system violates those principles, it is considered misuse.

Thank you for helping us keep SHEPHERD safe and aligned.
